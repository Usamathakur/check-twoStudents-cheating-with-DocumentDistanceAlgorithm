## Algorithm

1. Split documents into words. (8 different algorithms their time complexcity is respectively: 228.1s, 164.1s, 123.1s, 71.7, 18.3s, 11.5s, 1.8s, 0.2s)
2. compute word frequencies.
3. compute the dot product of the vector in the space.

This algorithm is done by traversing through the each word and that takes O(1) constant time in python. A vector in a 3D space with words like ("the cat", "the dog") we will give "the" to X Axis, "cat" to Y Axis and "dog" to Z Axis this will result into the Inner Product of vector (Dot Product). This is how the program finds the similarities between the two documents.
